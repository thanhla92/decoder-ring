Cipher Methods
Caesar Shift
The Caesar Shift, named after Julius Caesar who famously used it to encrypt his military communications, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals.

Polybius Square
The Polybius Square is another classic cipher, named after the ancient Greek historian Polybius. This method involves replacing each letter of the plaintext by a pair of numbers, representing its position in a grid of letters. For example, if we take a standard 5x5 grid populated with the alphabet (combining 'I' and 'J' to fit the 26 letters into 25 squares), the letter 'A' would be replaced by '11', 'B' by '21' and so on. This coordinates-based cipher method adds a layer of complexity to the encryption, making it slightly harder to break than simple substitution ciphers.

Substitution Cipher
The Substitution Cipher is a cipher method that involves replacing each letter in the plaintext with a different letter from a predetermined substitution alphabet. The recipient of the encoded message needs to have the same substitution alphabet to decode the message effectively. The substitution is determined by a 'key' which can be as simple as shifting the alphabet by a number of places, as in the Caesar Shift, or as complex as a random jumbling of all the letters.
