## Cipher Methods
### Caesar Shift
<p>The Caesar Shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.</p>

### Polybius Square
<p>The Polybius Square is another classic cipher, named after the ancient Greek historian Polybius. This method involves replacing each letter of the plaintext by a pair of numbers, representing its position in a grid of letters. For example, if we take a standard 5x5 grid populated with the alphabet (combining 'I' and 'J' to fit the 26 letters into 25 squares), the letter 'A' would be replaced by '11', 'B' by '21' and so on. This coordinates-based cipher method adds a layer of complexity to the encryption, making it slightly harder to break than simple substitution ciphers.</p>

### Substitution Cipher
<p>The Substitution Cipher is a cipher method that involves replacing each letter in the plaintext with a different letter from a predetermined substitution alphabet. The recipient of the encoded message needs to have the same substitution alphabet to decode the message effectively. The substitution is determined by a 'key' which can be as simple as shifting the alphabet by a number of places, as in the Caesar Shift, or as complex as a random jumbling of all the letters.</p>
